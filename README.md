# Year 2 OOSD

This assignment is to design and implement a computer system to support the association secretary, Brian, and the players. The aim is to develop the system using Java (and JavaFX) considering the following functionalities. This should be creative and come up with my own User Interface Design.  Working on this assignment will help me understand more clearly the concepts, problems, and techniques of object-oriented systems, and how these can be used to design and implement a reasonably large size software system (to a professional standard).

Here are some images  before developing from the use of UML diagrams.
